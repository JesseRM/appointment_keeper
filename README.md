# Appointment Keeper
Appointment Keeper is a simple appointment management system.  It allows a user to make and manage appointments. It is written in Java and uses JavaFX for the GUI. 

The major objectives of this project were:  
  **1.** Allow a user to see appointment times relative to the time zone they are in. Meaning that if a user in Los Angeles created an appointment for 8:00 AM a user in  
     in New York would see the appointment with a start time of 11:00 AM.  
  **2.** Allow a user to create an appointment with information such as a title, description, location and start and end times.  
  **3.** Allow a user to create a customer profile with information such as name, address and phone number.  
  **4.** Have the program present province options based on the country the user selects.  
  **5.** Use a relational database to persist data.
