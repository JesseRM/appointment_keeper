# Appointment Keeper
Appointment Keeper is a simple appointment management system.  It allows a user to make and manage appointments. It is written in Java and uses JavaFX for the GUI. 

The major objectives of this project were:  
  1. Allow a user to see appointment times relative to the time zone they are in. Meaning that if a user in Los Angeles created an appointment for 8:00 AM a user in
     in New York would see the appointment with a start time of 11:00 AM.  
  2. Allow a user to create and modify an appointment with information such as a title, description, location and start and end times.
  3. Allow a user to create and modify a customer profile with information such as name, address and phone number.
  4. Have the program present province options based on the country the user selects.
  5. Use a relational database to persist data.
